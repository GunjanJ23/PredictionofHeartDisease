In the recent years, heart diseases have been identified as one of the leading causes of death. The healthcare
industry is still lagging in implementing effective ways to store and retrieve medical records which leads to 
less usable data for implementing effective machine learning algorithm.

This project compares machine learning algorithm in case of limited training and testing examples. 
It encompasses the comparative study of methods to predict missing data. 

Random forest regressor performs the best for predicting the missing values with an accuracy of 54.34%. 
SVM performs the best for multi and binary classification.
